Introducing Newtype, a modular game engine designed for simplicity, minimal dependencies, and flexibility. Built in pure C++ and seamlessly integrating with the standard library, Newtype empowers you to create immersive gaming experiences with ease.

Our modular architecture lets you pick and choose the components you need for your project, from rendering to input handling. And with clear dependency information provided in the README, you'll have everything you need to get started quickly.

Welcome to Newtype. Welcome to possibility.
